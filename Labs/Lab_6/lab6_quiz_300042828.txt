elements in the stack, the placeholder is null). After a
stack element is popped, the position of the popped element
in the stack points to null, it is just not shown here
because we donâ€™t know the length of the array or linked list
used in this stack.Line 1: s = {8}Line 2: s = {8, 6}Line 3: num = 6; s = {8}Line 4: s = {8, 3}Line 5: s = {8, 3, 4}Line 6: s = {8, 3, 4, 15}Line 7: s = {8, 3, 4, 15, 12}Line 8: s = {8, 3, 4, 15}
// s.pop() is not stored anywhere.
// Thus, the topmost element is simply removed and not stored.
// Similar steps occur for the next few lines.Line 9: s = {8, 3, 4}Line 10: s = {8, 3}Line 11: s = {8, 3, 19}
